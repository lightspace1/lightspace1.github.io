-	Built course display and management **pages** for the microservices and the **components** for interacting with microservice **(Vue.js, Nuxt.js, HTML, AJAX, JavaScript, Element UI, XML)**
-	Developed **REST Controllers** to interact with AJAX call and microservices. (Spring MVC, Spring Could)
-	Used **MQ (RabbitMQ)** for developing messaging services to achieve asynchronous communication.
-	Designed **MySQL** database table and **MongoDB** schemas for each function and connected them by using **MyBatis, Spring Data, Hibernate.**
-	Implemented **Ouath2.0 Single sign-on** feature. **(Spring Security, Zuul and JWT)**
-	Documented the API **(Swagger)** and tested the API and microservice. **(Junit, Postman)**
**GitHub Link:** https://github.com/lightspace1/learn_lifelong

### HappyShop
#### May 2019 - Dec. 2019 : Developed for personal interest
HappyShop is a large B2B2C e-commerce distributed system with **Spring Framework, Spring MVC, Spring Security ,MyBatis** as the back end, **AngularJS and Bootstrap** as the front.
- Built homepages, product display pages, shopping cart pages, order pages, management system pages **(Bootstrap, HTML, JavaScript, XML)** and the components to retrieve data use **AJAX**. **(AngularJS)**
- Implemented a relational database Table **(MySQL)** to store information about the shopping platform and Built a NoSQL database schema **(MongoDB)** to store a large amount of product evaluation data. 
- Used **JDBC** to provide database connectivity to database tables, and developed the **MyBatis** configuration XML file containing the mapping between the domain objects and **SQL** statements for CRUD operations. 
- Developed **RESTful web services (Spring MVC)** to handle communication between different parts of the system.
- Integrated **JMS/MQ** with the system for interacting with different modules.
- Build and Deployed the application **(Maven, Docker)** and developed test cases for each function. (Junit)


### MyBooks E-Commerce Website
#### Mar. 2019 - May 2019: Developed for course project
Developed a high cohesion, low coupling **PHP** bookstore website based on **Laravel** framework and **MySQL** database.
-	Designed a **MySQL** relational database table.
-	Created user-friendly user login page, product display page, user management page, product management page and shopping cart page **(HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap)**.
-	Implemented **(Laravel, PHP)** bookstore website login and registration verification, multi-file upload and save, asynchronous data access **(jQuery, AJAX)**, user access control and user session saving. 
-	Delivered controller logic which connects pages and database. Applied the Eloquent ORM framework to convert MySQL data tables into corresponding PHP models. Built a highly cohesive, low-coupling bookstore website platform based on the **MVC** model.

### Product Recommendation System Based on User
#### Sept. 2019 - May 2020 : Developed for personal interest
Developing a recommendation system **(Hadoop, Kafka, Spark, Spark Streaming, Redis)**. The main purpose of the project is collecting user data and product data on an e-commerce platform to achieve personalized recommendations for users. 
-	Collects **(Flume, Sqoop)**, calculates **(spark)**, and stores **(Hbase)** user data and product data to construct user portraits and product images.
-	Developed a matching algorithm **(ALS collaborative filtering and Spark)** which predicts click-through rate.
-	Building a real-time system which collects **(Flume)** and stores **(Kafka)** user behavior logs in real time. System updates the product matching sets **(Spark Streaming)** while updating hot items and new products matching sets **(Radis)** in real time. 
-	Developing recommendation center logic to generate recommendations based on matching results and sorting results. 


### Automatic De-identification of Medical Records System
#### Nov. 2019 - Dec. 2019: Developed for the course project
Built a system that automatically hides personal information in a patient's medical records. By inputting medical records, the system outputs the corresponding medical records without personal information.
-	Implemented automatic document processing logic, which tokenizes sentences, words, pos tagging and chunking.
-	Constructed the corresponding regular expression which performs word analysis.
-	Based on processed data, the CRF model was trained to recognize key information such as location, age, name, and date. The accuracy rate was 92.2%, 72.7%, 96.7%, and 92% and the recall rate was 56.9%, 59%, 71.4% and 66%, respectively. 
-	Designed new relationship features and improved the date model by analyzing text features and relationships. The recall rate of the date model was increased from 66% to 90.4% and the accuracy rate was increased from 92% to 98.3%.

### Handwritten English Word Recognition Program
#### May 2019 - June 2019: Developed for the course project
Uses machine learning algorithms to convert handwritten word images into text format with an accuracy rating of 99.07%.
-	Delivered image processing logic that cuts (OpenCV) word images into individual English letters and labels them and converts them into uniform pixel data, and then integrates the pixel data as features into the model.
-	Constructed an image classifier (Bayesian classifier) to obtain the recognized letter result based on the pixel data. Classifier has a recognition accuracy rate of 62.68%.
-	Constructed a recognition result correction model (Hidden Markov Model) decoded with the Viterbi algorithm and obtained the recognized English words. This increased the accuracy rating to 99.07%. 
-	Built a RESTful web service (Flask), encoded and decoded images using Base64 encoding, and encapsulated word recognition logic into REST APIs for easy integration with other systems.
